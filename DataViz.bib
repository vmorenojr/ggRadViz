	abstract = {Describes data exploration techniques designed to classify DNA sequences. Several visualization and data mining techniques were used to validate and attempt to discover new methods for distinguishing coding DNA sequences (exons) from non-coding DNA sequences (introns). The goal of the data mining was to see whether some other, possibly non-linear combination of the fundamental position-dependent DNA nucleotide frequency values could be a better predictor than the AMI (average mutual information). We tried many different classification techniques including rule-based classifiers and neural networks. We also used visualization of both the original data and the results of the data mining to help verify patterns and to understand the distinction between the different types of data and classifications. In particular, the visualization helped us develop refinements to neural network classifiers, which have accuracies as high as any known method. Finally, we discuss the interactions between visualization and data mining and suggest an integrated approach.},

	abstract = {Data mining is sometimes treating data consisting of items representing measurements of a single property taken in different time points. In this case data can be understood as a time series of one feature. It is no exception when the clue for evaluation of such data is related to their development trends as observed in several successive time points. From the qualitative point of view one can distinguish three basic types of behaviour between two neighbouring time points: the value of the feature is stable (remains the same), it grows or it falls. This paper is concerned with identification of typical qualitative development patterns as they appear in the windows of given length in the considered time-stamped data and their utilization for specification of interesting subgroups.},

Formally, the main difference between them consists of a nonlinear normalization step inherent in RadViz. In this paper we show that, although RadViz can be useful when analyzing sparse data, in general this design choice limits its applicability and introduces several drawbacks for exploratory data analysis. In particular, we observe that the normalization step introduces nonlinear distortions, can encumber outlier detection, prevents associating the plots with useful linear mappings, and impedes estimating original data attributes accurately. In addition, users have greater flexibility when choosing different layouts and views of the data in star coordinates. Therefore, we suggest that analysts and researchers should carefully consider whether RadViz's normalization step is beneficial regarding the data sets' characteristics and analysis tasks.},

chemical property is expressed in the samples taken. This could reveal if there are clusters and outliers
that have specific distinguishing properties. Current multivariate visualization methods lack the
ability to reveal these types of information at a sufficient degree of fidelity since they are not optimized
to simultaneously present the relations of the samples as well as the relations of the samples to their
attributes. We propose a display that is designed to reveal these multiple relations. Our scheme is
based on the concept of RadViz, but enhances the layout with three stages of iterative refinement.
These refinements reduce the layout error in terms of three essential relationships—sample to sample,
attribute to attribute, and sample to attribute. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via
various real-world domain examples in the domain of chemical process engineering. In addition,
we also formally derive the equivalence of RadViz to a popular multivariate interpolation method
called generalized barycentric coordinates.},

Extending the number of dimensions can enhance the flexibility

rationally extends a dimension to multiple new dimensions in
Radviz. This method first calculates the probability distribution
histogram of a dimension. The mean shift algorithm is applied to
get centers of probability density to segment the histogram, and
then the dimension can be extended according to the number of
segments of the histogram. We also suggest using the Dunn’s
index to find the optimal placement of DAs, so the better effect of
visual clustering could be achieved after the dimension expansion
in Radviz. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our approach

We have employed RadViz in 2D exploratory data analysis. However, with the increase of dataset size and dimensionality, the clumping of projected data points towards the origin in RadViz causes low space utilization, which largely degenerates the visibility of the feature characteristics. In this study, to better evaluate the hidden patterns in the center region, we propose histogram-based techniques to manipulate the radial distribution of data points in RadViz. We present RadViz in the polar coordinate system for convenient radial operations. Based on this, we define the radial equalization method to automatically spread out the frequency and the radial specification method to shape the distribution based on the user's requirement. Furthermore, we utilize the information in high-dimensional space as histogram and reference point to design and control the radial distribution of RadViz. Computational experiments have been conducted on turbine performance simulation data. Our proposed techniques are shown advantageous in query result display and outlier detection with a set of high-dimensional datasets.},

	abstract = {With today's flood of data coming from many types of sources, Machine Learning becomes increasingly important. Though, many times the use of Machine Learning is not enough to make sense of all this data. This makes visualization a very useful tool for Machine Learning practitioners and data analysts alike. Interactive visualization techniques can be very helpful by giving insight on the meaning of the output from classification tasks. This also applies to the data itself, as visualization can make some characteristics of the data become clear. Several bi-dimensional projection methods have been used to visualize data instances based on their attribute values. This visualization is more difficult when the instances have a large number of attributes. One of the visualization techniques that can deal with high dimensional data is Radial Coordinates Visualization (RadViz). RadViz can also be employed to visualize the performance of a probabilistic classifier, helping a user to find problematic instances that might have been misclassified. In this study, a new approach to use RadViz is proposed and investigated. The proposed approach combines the two aforementioned uses of RadViz (attribute-based data exploration and result exploration based on the output of probabilistic classification). For such, it approach provides an easy transition between the two types of visualization. This allows the context to be preserved, since the user can visually track the same data instance from one type of visualization to the other. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a prototype, named DualRadviz, was implemented. On this prototype, in addition to RadViz, visualization by Parallel Coordinates is also provided, so that precise instance inspection can be performed, since, different from RadViz, Parallel coordinates visualization does not suffer from ambiguity. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, a case study is presented.},

In this work, the results produced by an automated method (Self Organizing Maps (SOM)) and a visual metaphor (RadViz) are committed into a strict cooperation through a middle layer.

We propose that the dimension arrangement should be computed at the multidimensional space by analyzing reference vectors produced by SOM. The reference vectors are analyzed so that similar dimensions become neighbors. Later the achieved dimension arrangement is communicated to RadViz for rendering proposes and used to render the instances. Expert users can analyze all neurons, a combination of neurons or isolated neurons. The dimension arrangement represents a relational and universal order established for dimensions.

A crucial aspect of this technique lies in the arrangement of the dimensions, which determines the quality of the posterior visualization. Dimension arrangement (DA) has been shown to be an NP-problem and different heuristics have been proposed to solve it using optimization techniques. However, very little work has focused on understanding the relation between the arrangement of the dimensions and the quality of the visualization. In this paper we first present two variations of the DA problem: (1) a Radviz independent approach and (2) a Radviz dependent approach. We then describe the use of the Davies-Bouldin index to automatically evaluate the quality of a visualization i.e., its visual usefulness. Our empirical evaluation is extensive and uses both real and synthetic data sets in order to evaluate our proposed methods and to fully understand the impact that parameters such as number of samples, dimensions, or cluster separability have in the relation between the optimization algorithm and the visualization tool.},

	abstract = {Visual analysis of multidimensional data requires expressive and effective ways to reduce data dimensionality to encode them visually. Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a core building block in visualizing multidimensional data. For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.},

A new visualization technique called Star Coordinates is presented to support users in early stages of their visual thinking activities. Star Coordinates arranges coordinates on a circle sharing the same origin at the center. It uses simply points to represent data, treating each dimension uniformly at the cost of coarse representation. Current implementation of Star Coordinates provided valuable insight on several real data sets for cluster discovery and multifactor analysis tasks. The work on Star Coordinates will continue on developing advanced transformations that will improve data understanding in multi-dimensions.},

	abstract = {RadViz visualization makes it possible to map data from n-dimensional space into a plane. The paper reviews those specific properties of this method that are important for identification of clusters in the original multidimensional data. First, there is described an artificial data set which clearly points to a certain drawback of the original RadViz mapping. To resolve the identified problem there are suggested 2 minor modifications of the RadViz algorithm. Finally, it is proved that application of both suggested modifications guarantees that the upper mentioned problem does not re-appear. This claim is experimentally confirmed by a new visualization of the two original data sets using the modified mapping algorithm.},

To show a set of points in an n-dimensional space, a backdrop is drawn consisting of n parallel lines, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point.
This visualization is closely related to time series visualization, except that it is applied to data where the axes do not correspond to points in time, and therefore do not have a natural order. Therefore, different axis arrangements may be of interest.},
